## Serotonin Keyboard Layout

A keyboard layout for split keyboards with 'E' on the thumb cluster. Currently the number one spot for lowest total word effort on cyanophage (that could change). The left hand is
inspired heavily from [Gallium](https://github.com/GalileoBlues/Gallium) and [Graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout).

### Layout

The goal for the layout was to have a well rounded typing experience with no glaring weaknesses. Additionally, to push the boundaries of efficiency by achieving top tier stats in all categories.
